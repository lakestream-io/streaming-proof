/**
 * A record representing a request to create new producers in the streaming proof system.
 * This immutable record encapsulates all necessary information to initialize and start
 * a group of producers for performance and reliability testing.
 *
 * <p>The record is used by the {@link io.streamnative.streaming.proof.Worker} to create
 * and manage producer instances that will generate test messages with specific patterns
 * and rates.
 *
 * <p>When {@code transactional} is true, each producer will:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Write messages to input topic ({topic}_transactional)</li>
 *   <li>Start an embedded transactional processor</li>
 *   <li>The processor will read from input topic and write to output topic ({topic}) atomically</li>
 *   <li>Consumers will read from output topic for exactly-once verification</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Driver kafkaDriver = new Driver("kafka", kafkaConfigs);
 * NewProducers producers = new NewProducers(
 *     "proof-123",      // unique identifier
 *     "test-topic",     // topic name (output topic)
 *     4,                // number of producer instances
 *     100,              // number of unique message keys
 *     1000,             // message rate (msgs/sec)
 *     "kafka",          // driver name
 *     kafkaDriver,      // messaging system driver
 *     true              // enable transactional processing
 * );
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param id A unique identifier for this group of producers, typically matching
 *          the proof test ID they belong to
 * @param topic The base topic name. If transactional=true, producers write to {topic}_transactional
 *             and consumers read from {topic}. If transactional=false, both write to and read from {topic}
 * @param producers The number of producer instances to create, enabling parallel
 *                 message production for higher throughput
 * @param keys The number of unique message keys to use across all producers,
 *            affecting the distribution and partitioning of messages
 * @param msgRate The target message production rate in messages per second,
 *               distributed across all producer instances
 * @param driverName The name of the messaging system driver
 * @param driver The messaging system driver configuration that specifies how to
 *              create and configure the producer instances
 * @param transactional If true, enables exactly-once processing using embedded transactional processors
