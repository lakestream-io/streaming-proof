/**
 * Manages a group of producer tasks for streaming proof tests. This class coordinates
 * multiple producers to generate messages at a controlled rate while maintaining
 * sequence tracking for verification.
 *
 * <p>Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Rate-limited message production using {@link UniformRateLimiter}</li>
 *   <li>Fair distribution of keys across multiple producers</li>
 *   <li>Sequence tracking per message key</li>
 *   <li>Aggregated producer statistics collection</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For exactly-once processing, the class creates {@link KafkaExactlyOnceProofProducer}
 * instances that embed transactional processors for atomic read-process-write operations.
 *
 * <p>The class uses a virtual thread to coordinate message production across
 * all producer tasks, ensuring controlled message rates and fair task scheduling
 * with minimal resource overhead.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Driver kafkaDriver = new Driver("kafka", kafkaConfigs);
 * NewProducers config = new NewProducers(
 *     "test-producers",  // unique group ID
 *     "test-topic",     // topic to produce to
 *     4,                // number of producers
 *     100,              // number of unique keys
 *     5000,             // messages per second
 *     kafkaDriver       // messaging system driver
 * );
 *
 * ProofProducers producers = new ProofProducers(config);
 * producers.start();
 *
 * // Later, check production progress
 * CheckPoint checkpoint = producers.checkPoint();
 *
 * // Finally, stop all producers
 * producers.stop();
 * }</pre>
