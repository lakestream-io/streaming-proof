/**
 * Manages producer and consumer instances for streaming proof verification on a worker node.
 * 
 * <p>The Worker is a distributed component that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Manages multiple concurrent producer and consumer groups</li>
 *   <li>Creates, configures, and monitors messaging clients</li>
 *   <li>Collects detailed checkpoints for verification analysis</li>
 *   <li>Provides thread-safe operation in multi-tenant environments</li>
 *   <li>Optimizes resource usage through driver instance caching</li>
 *   <li>Supports horizontal scaling across multiple worker nodes</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Workers operate as part of a distributed verification system where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each worker can be deployed in a different zone/region</li>
 *   <li>Multiple verification tasks can run concurrently on each worker</li>
 *   <li>Producers generate sequentially numbered messages with unique keys</li>
 *   <li>Consumers track received sequences using range-based checkpoints</li>
 *   <li>The coordinator periodically collects these checkpoints for analysis</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each producer and consumer group is identified by a unique ID, allowing
 * multiple verification scenarios to run concurrently on the same worker node.
